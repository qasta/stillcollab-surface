This page demonstrate the simplest way to import and use Surface in your project


= Import the module =

The first step is to Import the Surface module to your project. To do that, add this line in your module descriptor (.gwt.xml) :

{{{
<inherits name='com.axeiya.stillcollab.wysiwyg.Wysiwyg'/>
}}}

= Create an editing surface =

The second step is to instantiate an editing surface called Surface. The default Surface implementation is the ContentEditableSurface, which uses a div with the contentEditable attribute.

{{{
Surface editor = new ContentEditableSurface();
}}}

= Create a toolbar =

With stillcollab-surface, the toolbar and the editing surface are splitted, because in a lot of cases we have to use a unique toolbar for many surfaces and reverse.
Every one can create its own toolbar, but in this example we will instantiate the DefaultToolBar :

{{{
DefaultToolBar toolBar = new DefaultToolBar();
}}}

= Register the surface in the toolbar =

To link the toolbar and the surface, we have to declare the surface to the toolbar. This is done with the addManagedSurface method :

{{{
toolBar.addManagedSurface(editor2);
}}}

= Put the two component in the UI =

To finish, we just have to add them on the UI :

{{{
RootPanel.get().add(toolBar);
RootPanel.get().add(editor);
}}}
