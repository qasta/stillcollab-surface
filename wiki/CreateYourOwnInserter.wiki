#summary How to create a custom DOM inserter with stillcollab-surface

= Introduction =

One of the most important functionality of Surface is the ability to define and add customs inserters.
As it is mentioned in the project summary, Surface does not rely on execCommand, but on custom hand-written DOM inserters. At root, Surface brings two inserters, BlockInserter and InlineInserter (both inheriting from Inserter).

== BlockInserter ==

The BlockInserter allows to create a surrounding Element around the selection. Example :

{{{
 <p>My |sample <span>text</span></p>
 <p>My second| paragraph</p>
}}}
_The | represents the start and end point of the selection_

If I _BlockInsert_ this selection with a PRE element, Surface will produce :
{{{
 <p>My </p>
 <pre>
  <p>sample <span>text</span></p>
  <p>My second</p>
 </pre>
 <p> paragraph</p>
}}}

This inserter is currently used for a lot of inserters, like Pre, Quote, List, Paragraph etc.

== InlineInserter ==
The InlineInserter allows to create TEXT_NODE surrounding Element around the selection.

Example :
{{{
 <p>My |sample <span>text</span></p>
 <p>My second| paragraph</p>
}}}
_The | represents the start and end point of the selection_

If I _InlineInsert_ this selection with a EM element, Surface will produce :
{{{
 <p>My <em>sample </em><span><em>text</em></span></p>
 <p><em>My second</em> paragraph</p>
}}}

This inserter is currently used for text inserters, like Italic, Bold etc.
